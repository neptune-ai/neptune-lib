neptune-lib: open-source Neptune.ml API
===========================================

A lightweight library that lets you programatically access neptune experiment data.
With neptune-lib you can download the data to your local machine for:
 * experiment view 
 * numerical channels values for every experiment
 * hardware utilization for every experiment
 * much more
  
And the best thing is you can extend it yourself or... tell us to do it for you :).
